# AMAZON-SALES-ANALYSIS
For this project, I utilized Amazon sales data sourced from Kaggle. The dataset required cleaning to eliminate duplicates, correct erroneous dates, and format columns for text, dates, numbers, and currency consistency. Using pivot tables, I conducted a detailed sales performance analysis across various parameters to extract meaningful insights.

Subsequently, I translated the pivot table findings into chart visuals. These visuals were then integrated into a user-friendly dashboard, designed to highlight key summaries derived from the data analysis. The resulting dashboard offers a clear and actionable overview of the sales data, aiding in informed decision-making
